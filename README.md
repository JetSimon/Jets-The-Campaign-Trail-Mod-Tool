# Jets-The-Campaign-Trail-Mod-Maker

This is a tool to aid with the creation mods for the game [The Campaign Trail](https://www.americanhistoryusa.com/campaign-trail/).

Currently it helps by organizing all the data for Code 2 of a mod file after you import it. Then you can edit your mod graphically without having to mess around in a text editor (or even worse, Google Drive).

Download and run the .exe from the releases folder.
