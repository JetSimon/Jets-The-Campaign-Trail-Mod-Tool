# Jets-The-Campaign-Trail-Mod-Maker

This is a graphical mod creation tool for [The Campaign Trail](https://www.americanhistoryusa.com/campaign-trail/).

Currently it supports importing code 2 files and then exporting them to share with others. If you do not have a code 2 to base off of, you can find them in the modding community or use [one I have here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetSimon/Jets-The-Campaign-Trail-Mod-Tool/main/src/default_code2.js) as a default.

Features
* Complete GUI interface - no coding strictly required
* Ability to add and delete answers and provides a centralized place to modify answer effects and feedback without flipping around files
* Generates new PKs automatically
* Import existing code 2s and build off of them
* Export and share

What this modding tool CANNOT do (yet):
* Code 1 creation (though this part is generally seen as the “easier” part of modding, so I think you guys got this!)
* Does not support CYOA, custom endings, or any other mods that involve custom JavaScript
* Does not add any aesthetic changes to the end of code 2. You’ll have to add those manually after export.

You can download here on GitHub in the “releases” folder (currently only Windows, but you can build from source or I can make a Mac version if there is enough demand).

If you have any issues report them on the GitHub in the issues tab.

Happy mod making,

Jet
